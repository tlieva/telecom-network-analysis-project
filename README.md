# Data Science Portfolio

## Introduction
This is a repository of data science projects completed for academic, self-learning, and professional purposes. Projects are primarily completed using Python Jupyter Notebook, SAS, and in R programming.

### Data Analysis Projects
**1. Telecommunication Network Analysis (Capstone Project):** Self-direct field group project done in collaboration with a telecommunication service provider. Final end-product included the following to optimize network service recommendations to clients based on observed traffic micro trends:
- A static analytical model of network telemetry data as framework for future real-time analysis for live level data integration
- Interactive dashboard using internal network telemetry data for network traffic categorization, network re-classification in reference to
IANA (repository of network traffic based on port numbers and protocols), and analysis of servers/IoT that are taking bandwidth
- Developed an RFM scoring-based approach in identifying target customer segment based on network usage, frequency, and connections.
- Application(s) used: Python, Tableau

### Database Projects
**1. JP Morgan Chase & Co. Branch Optimization:** collaborative term project completed in analyzing a sample of the firm's retail deposits data at the branch level from 2010 to 2016, with the goal of providing branch optimization strategies for 9% increase in customer retention and overall bank growth via top-down approach.
- Identified underperforming branches of concern that would require new optimization strategies based on 3 key KPI analyzed for each segment: Y-o-Y growth rate, average deposits, and share of segment by state, county, and city level.
- Developed forecasting models to predict future growth rates to further support strategic planning.
- Application(s) used: SQL-SAS for data cleaning and transformation; data modelling and forecasting using Tableau.
