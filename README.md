### Data Analysis & Visualization Projects
1. [**JP Morgan Chase & Co. Branch Optimization:**](https://github.com/tlieva/JPM-branch-optimization-project.git) collaborative term project completed in analyzing a sample of the firm's retail deposits data at the branch level from 2010 to 2016, with the goal of providing branch optimization strategies for 9% increase in customer retention and overall bank growth via top-down approach.

2. [**Telecommunication Network Analysis (Capstone Project):**] Self-direct field group project done in collaboration with a telecommunication service provider. Final end-product included the following to optimize network service recommendations to clients based on observed traffic micro trends:
- A static analytical model of network telemetry data as framework for future real-time analysis for live level data integration
- Interactive dashboard using internal network telemetry data for network traffic categorization, network re-classification in reference to
IANA (repository of network traffic based on port numbers and protocols), and analysis of servers/IoT that are taking bandwidth
- Developed an RFM scoring-based approach in identifying target customer segment based on network usage, frequency, and connections.
- Application(s) used: Python, Tableau
