# Telecom Network Analysis Capstone Project

Repository for a self-direct capstone project done in collaboration with a telecommunication service provider based in Vancouver, BC CAN. This was completed as part my post-graduate studies in Analytics for Business Decision-Making at George Brown College (BUS 4045	Data Project Capstone Project) where my team and I had the opportunity to work for a client in support of a data-driven business decision. Output of the project is structured as a series of reports and final presentation to the faculty and client through the various stages of the engagement.

#### Final Deliverables
My team and I aimed to provide our client a static analytical model of network telemetry data as framework for future real-time analysis for live level data integration that would include an interactive dashboard using internal network telemetry data for network traffic categorization, network re-classification in reference to IANA (repository of network traffic based on port numbers and protocols), and analysis of peak times in data use. In addition, we also developed an RFM scoring-based approach in identifying target customer segment based on network usage, frequency, and number of connections. Our main objective was to provide our client a tool that would help optimize their network service recommendations to customers based on observed traffic micro-trends.
