# Telecom Network Analysis Project

## Introduction



2. [**Telecommunication Network Analysis (Capstone Project):**] Self-direct field group project done in collaboration with a telecommunication service provider. Final end-product included the following to optimize network service recommendations to clients based on observed traffic micro trends:
- A static analytical model of network telemetry data as framework for future real-time analysis for live level data integration
- Interactive dashboard using internal network telemetry data for network traffic categorization, network re-classification in reference to
IANA (repository of network traffic based on port numbers and protocols), and analysis of servers/IoT that are taking bandwidth
- Developed an RFM scoring-based approach in identifying target customer segment based on network usage, frequency, and connections.
- Application(s) used: Python, Tableau
