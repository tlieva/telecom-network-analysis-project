# Telecom Network Analysis Project

Repository for a self-direct capstone project done in collaboration with a telecommunication service provider based in Vancouver, BC CAN. This was completed as part my post-graduate studies in Analytics for Business Decision-Making at George Brown College (BUS 4045	Data Project Capstone Project) where my team and I had the opportunity to work for a client in support of a data-driven business decision. Output of the project is structured as a series of reports and final presentation to the faculty and client through the various stages of the engagement.

#### Final Deliverables
This included the following end-products to optimize network service recommendations to customers based on observed traffic micro-trends:
- A static analytical model of network telemetry data as framework for future real-time analysis for live level data integration
- Interactive dashboard using internal network telemetry data for network traffic categorization, network re-classification in reference to
IANA (repository of network traffic based on port numbers and protocols), and analysis of servers/IoT that are taking bandwidth
- Developed an RFM scoring-based approach in identifying target customer segment based on network usage, frequency, and connections.
- Application(s) used: Python, Tableau
