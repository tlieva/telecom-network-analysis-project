**[JP Morgan Chase & Co. Branch Optimization:](https://github.com/tlieva/data-science-portfolio/blob/a82b146a50d059a297352dd347339da829d1d477/JPMorgan-Branch-Optimization-Analytical-File)** term project in analyzing a sample of the firm's retail deposits data at the branch level from 2010 to 2016, with the goal of providing branch optimization strategies for 9% increase in customer retention and overall bank growth via top-down approach.
- Identified underperforming branches of concern that would require new optimization strategies based on 3 key KPI analyzed for each segment: Y-o-Y growth rate, average deposits, and share of segment by state, county, and city level.
- Developed forecasting models to predict future growth rates to further support strategic planning.
- Application(s) used: SQL-SAS for data cleaning and transformation; data modelling and forecasting using Tableau.
